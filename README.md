**Repeat that Beat** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Jose Eduardo Paredes**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
While this first challenge isn’t a technical one, it was one that I encountered in creating the submissions nevertheless; in the time I spent working on the submission, I discovered how much I could improve my time management skills. By organizing myself and dedicating at least 2 hours a day to working on the pre-work or do research pertaining to improving the project/learning some of the technology used, I was able to get more done for a project than ever before. Being much more consistent with the effort I apply rewarded me with being able to complete the pre-work in a timely manner while learning a lot about web development and whether I would like it or not-in short, I absolutely would. Forcing yourself to work on tasks that go beyond what is currently asked of you, in my case that would be school and food delivery, allowed me to reach levels of productivity that I hadn’t seen before. Another challenge I faced when creating the submission was sticking to the actual work to be done and not diving off into every rabbit hole of knowledge that there is on topics related to web development; it’s easy for me to get distracted trying to understand more and more without actually making tangible progress on the project. Overcoming it was a matter of catching and forcing myself to focus on what is currently at hand rather than what I want to learn moving forward. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Despite its low-entry point as a software career track, web development involves a multitude of different, yet interconnected, technical bodies of knowledge. To start, I would like to understand how web applications are hosted, and how one would go about hosting their own server; I ask this first because the prework-while a great introduction into HTML, CSS, and Javascript- does not go into the depths of the back-end web development and allows Glitch to do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to dynamically hosting/updating the website. That said, my thirst for knowledge is not satisfied with only understanding how the pre-work tech stack works in tandem to create the interactive front-end of a web application. Additionally, I’m curious to know when the best scenarios are to use certain tech stacks? For example, the community around the Python programming language agree upon its usefulness and potential in data analytics, machine learning, and AI; then again, using a web framework like Django allows “...web applications to go from concept to launch in a matter of hours.” (Django website, overview). What are the tradeoffs in using a tech stack like Python, and Django for example as opposed to a more traditional/popular one like HTML, CSS, JS, React.js, Node.js, etc? Another question would be: how are APIs built/why and how have they taken over as the preferred method of interfacing with web application/services? Moreover, I would love to be familiar with the history and timeline of when this change occurred. What software design patterns are most commonly used in web development? How can a web developer ever stay ahead of the curve when new technologies are emerging every day and solving issues that were more commonplace the day, week, or year before? Simply put, my questions can be grouped together into a ‘how to understand every facet of full-stack development’ FAQ.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Having a few more hours to work on the project would allow me to spend time researching, learning, and implementing anything I didn’t understand or know of before. For example, adding different UIs with differing themes for each button/sound would be neat; seasonal themes were the first to come into mind, then holiday themes, and finally animal/ecosystem themed– to illustrate, each theme would have different noises/sounds/notes that correspond with its theme. As for the functionality of the game, I would spend more time trying to implement a different difficulty settings ranging from easy, medium, hard, to very hard with the time to guess in between each clue lessened with each difficulty setting as well as a decreasing amount of guesses; the very hard difficulty would have an instant lose feature where the player would lose if the wrong note is played, or played for a longer/shorter time than it was during the clue. Apart from that, I would spend a fair bit of time learning CSS and styling the UI, making it more attractive to the user. Additionally, I thought of the musical learning capacity of this project and how it could be refactored towards teaching and remembering musical notes/pitches. For example, there can be a larger array of buttons that play notes, which are then displayed when pressed, as a base screen; then the actual game can randomize the notes on screen and ask you to choose which note is being played. Finally, on top of both of these different ideas/applications of these web apps, the next thought was scalability; I would love to convert even a simple game like this into a system with its own architecture, design, and allow users to create profiles, play against friends or anyone in queue!
